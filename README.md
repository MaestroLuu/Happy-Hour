## Installation

To edit this application, you need a coding software like the free [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a working web browser like [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), a way to store databases like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) along with [MongodbCompass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass), and a way to test the backend/frontend queries/mutations using the software [ApolloGraphql](https://www.apollographql.com/). For the rest of the requirements, you just need to run ```npm i``` to get the neccessary packages from the package.json.

## Usage

Unless you're using this project as a boiler plate or as example code, you can instead just go straight to the [herokuapp](https://desolate-earth-02940.herokuapp.com/) instead. Otherwise you're free to edit the `models/schemas` in the `server` folder along with the `utils` in the `client` folder in order to change the data you want to connect. Make sure to ```.cp .env.Example .env``` in order to get a copy of the environmental variables that you need for the server to launch. Also connect an online database like [MongodbAtlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
